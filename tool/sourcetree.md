SourceTree provides git and mercurial repository management on desktop OSs.

## Key Features

### Remotes
Sourcetree allows any git or mercurial hosting provider or server solution to be a remote, and allows for verious authentication methods.  Credentials are stored centerally for each provider so that the same auentications and commit information is used for all repositories.

A repository can have multiple remotes attached to it, so is perfect for forked repositories where work is done in both the original and the fork by the same person.

### Merge/Diff
Built in merge and diff tools allow easy conflict resolution and change viewing.  Simple colour highlighting is used for added and removed lines to allow for both inline change viewing as well as side-by-side.

SourceTree also supports integration with most other diff/merge tools, so if you already have a prefered tool you can quickly and easily continue using it whilst still having git flow managed by SourceTree

### Repository Management
Repositories can be stored anywhere on a system, including remote file shares, and then categorised into nested folders within the client.

For each repository you can quickly and ealy view the commit history with a visual view of commits and descriptions in all branches.  The clear change graph shows how all changes relate to one another, as well as options to perform checkouts, cherry picks and reverts is needed.  Rebasing is also possibly after several warnings.

## Pricing
SourceTree is free for all user, although you do have to register for a free Atlassian Account after 30 days to continue using it.
