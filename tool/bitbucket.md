Bitbucket is a code hosting tool that allows unlimited private repositories to anyone.

## Key Features

### Repositories
Repositories are where code is stored, and can belong to an individual or a team.  From the browser you can view the code in a repository, as well as perform most of the analysis operations that you'd need a git client to do.  Each repository also has issues and wiki attached to it, to allow for easy storing of notes and documentation as well as tracking issues with the code.

For all repositories the access permissions of a user can be controlled finely from read-only though to administrative access.  This prevents unauthorised operations.

In the web viewer, all markdown files are rendered so any documentation saved as part of the repository can be instantly viewed.

### Teams
Teams allow easy collaboration as a group of people can work on projects with shared ownership.  There are limits on team sizes based on your subscription, but open source collaboration is unlimited.  Teams can benefit from all of the inegrations offered by single repositoried with common features across all of that teams code.

### Projects
A project is a group of repositories being worked on by a team.  They help control releases and team goals by giving a common aim across work being done in several areas.

## Other Features

### Integrations
Atlassian have a lot of development related products to help teams work together.  Most of them integrate directly into Bitbucket and provide enhancements to the default feature set.

Jira can be used to enhance issues, Confluence to improve the wiki, FishEye & Crucible for code reviews, and HipChat for team communication.

### Snippets
Snippets let you store small code samples in an easy way outside of a repository.  Whilst they're not suitable for any large code they're a good way to store reusable code, code samples or to share ideas.  The same sharing permissions as for a repository can be applied to a snippet.

## Availability
There are two versions of Bitbucket, Cloud and Server, which are targeted at different audiences but have much the same features.

### Bitbucket Cloud
Hosted by Atlassian, BitBucket Cloud is the instant solution for people working in small teams.  For teams of up to 5 people, or University Students, Bitbucket Cloud is free without limits on the amount of private repositories you have.  For plans including more team members, they are available on monthly rolling subscriptions so are good for companies who have extra staff during major projects but don't want to pay larger subscriptions the rest of the year.

### Bitbucket Server
Formerly known as Stash, Bitbucket Server is an enterprie offering running as software on a variety of server platforms.  The core features are the same, but with scalability options to give more resources to servers as and when needed, as well as the ability to use add-ons to increase functionality beyond the standard Atlassian integrations.  Server is a one time licence purchase staring at $10.
